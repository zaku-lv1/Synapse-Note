# Vercel Not Found Error Fix

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing "Not Found" errors when deployed to Vercel, while working fine in test environments. The specific error occurred with URLs like `/kix1::c4hj6-1752593023673-052bf7d40ab6`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by several factors:
1. **Strict Firebase initialization**: The app would crash if Firebase credentials weren't properly configured
2. **Complex routing logic**: The catch-all route handler for quiz IDs was making database calls that could fail in serverless environments
3. **Missing error handling**: Database connection failures weren't handled gracefully
4. **Serverless environment differences**: Vercel's serverless functions have different behavior than traditional Express servers

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Resilient Firebase Initialization
- Changed Firebase initialization to be non-blocking
- App continues to run even if Firebase credentials are missing
- Added fallback to memory session store when Firestore is unavailable

### 2. Lazy Database Connections
- Replaced direct `admin.firestore()` calls with lazy initialization functions
- All route files now check database availability before making queries
- Graceful error handling when database is not available

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added timeout protection for database queries (5-10 seconds)
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Consistent error page rendering instead of crashes

### 4. Enhanced Routing Logic
- Quiz-like IDs now redirect to `/quiz/:id` format instead of crashing
- Improved pattern matching to avoid false positives
- Better separation between quiz IDs and regular page names

### 5. Vercel Configuration
- Added function timeout configuration
- Optimized for serverless environment behavior

## Files Modified

### server.js
- Resilient Firebase initialization
- Enhanced session configuration with fallback
- Improved catch-all route handler with timeouts
- Better health check endpoint

### routes/*.js
- Lazy database initialization in all route files
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Timeout protection for database queries

### vercel.json
- Added function timeout configuration

## Testing Results
✅ Server starts successfully without Firebase credentials  
✅ Quiz-like URLs redirect properly instead of causing crashes  
✅ Regular pages continue to work normally  
✅ Health endpoint provides useful debugging information  
✅ Graceful degradation when database is unavailable  

## Deployment Checklist for Vercel

1. **Environment Variables**: Set the following in Vercel dashboard:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Strong random string
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Firebase project ID
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`: Service account JSON as string
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google AI API key (optional)

2. **Health Check**: After deployment, check `/health` endpoint to verify configuration

3. **Test Routes**: Verify that quiz-like URLs redirect properly and don't cause 500 errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Quiz-like URLs (e.g., `/kix1::c4hj6-1752593023673-052bf7d40ab6`):
- **Before**: 500 Internal Server Error or application crash
- **After**: 302 redirect to `/quiz/kix1%3A%3Ac4hj6-1752593023673-052bf7d40ab6`, then proper 404 page if quiz doesn't exist

### For Regular Pages:
- **Before**: Working fine
- **After**: Continues to work normally

### For Database Issues:
- **Before**: Application crash
- **After**: Graceful error pages with helpful messages

## Monitoring
Use the `/health` endpoint to monitor:
- Database connection status
- Firebase credential configuration
- Overall application health

Example health response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "databaseConnection": "connected",
  "firebase": true,
  "credentials": {
    "firebaseJson": true,
    "projectId": true
  }
}
```
